# weather

## TODO:

You should be able to search for a specific location and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.

You should change the look of the page based on the data, maybe by changing the color of the background or by adding images that describe the weather.

add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to test for low-end devices.
